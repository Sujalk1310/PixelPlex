* Do same with `Backend` directory and install all the dependencies.
* If dependencies are not installed automatically you can take reference of what dependencies to be installed below.
* Launch the **Backend-Server** by using the command `npm start` in the specific folder.
* Launch **Frontend** by using command `npm run dev` in the specific folder.
* The site should be live at `http://localhost:5173/`.
